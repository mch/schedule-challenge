  - how many attendees, and how many sessions?
- attendee want to be able to create short list of sessions they're interested in.
- attendee want to sign up for the sessions (reserve a seat for them in that session)
  - does the room has enough capacity to for all the attendees?
  - does the room capacity follow the fire code?
