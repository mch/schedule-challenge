# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-02-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. We want to capture the why of our design decision
- We want to keep ADR next to the code so that we can find the ADR revelance to the version of the code and use git to track history the same way we use it for the code.
- We will keep a collection of records for "architecturally significant" decisions: those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, construction techniques, how we work together such as the mise tool we use to keep consistent tooling on all developer and the process we use.
- If it's not clear we need an ADR, let's talk about it.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
