Date: 2025-02-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The goal of this project is learn and explore a bunch of software development technique, tools, and concepts. We want to capture this learning so we can refer back to it, use it to product blog post, conference talks, etc...

## Decision

create doc/learning directory and create md files for each subject within. We write down questions/answers/definitions/glossary and references to other materials.

## Consequences

- we need to put effort into document the learnings.
- we can share with others about our learnings and experiences.
